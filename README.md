# 🐍 Python OOP Assignment (Week 5)

This repo contains solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment.  

## 🏗️ Assignment 1: Custom Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes + methods  
- Added inheritance with a `GamingPhone` subclass  
- Example actions: call, take photo, play game  

## 🎭 Assignment 2: Polymorphism
- Defined a base `Vehicle` class with `move()` method  
- Implemented subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`)  
- Each subclass defines `move()` differently  

## 🖥️ How to Run
Run each file in terminal:  
```bash
python assignment1_class.py
python assignment2_polymorphism.py
